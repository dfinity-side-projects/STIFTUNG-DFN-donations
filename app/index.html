            <h3>Important Notes</h3>
            <p>This special "ETH forwarding address" was created from your DFN seed.</p>
            <p>Whenever this application detects that the "ETH forwarding address" has received ETH, it forwards the ETH
                to the Stiftung DFINITY smart contracts that are collecting donations.</p>
            <p>Stiftung DFINITY records the value donated in Swiss Francs (CHF) and uses this to calculate
                recommendations for genesis dfinities. Its systems are regularly updated with the CHF to ETH exchange
                rate for this purpose.</p>
            <p>When a total of 1M CHF in value has been received, Stiftung DFINITY will stop accepting further ETH
                donations. The application will allow you to withdraw any ETH you sent to the forwarding address after
                the limit was reached.</p>
            <p>Note that there is a small Ethereum gas cost associated with each donation, and this is deducted from the
                amount.</p>

        <h3>The DFINITY Network and DFN</h3></p>
        <p class="c2 c3"><h3></h3></p>
        <p class="c2"><span>Research, designs, cryptography and proof-of-concept software has been created and
                proposed in relation to an open and decentralized cloud computing platform (the &ldquo;DFINTY Network&rdquo;)
                that involves advanced blockchain technology and techniques. It is necessary for the DFINITY Network
                to host special cryptographic digital information units (&ldquo;DFN&rdquo;) that mediate participation
                in its functions and access to its resources. At the current time, the DFINITY Network concept involves
                the DFN participation tokens enabling and mediating participation in four ways:</span></p>
        <p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p><ul class="c4 lst-kix_sqrltz50h3q6-0 start"><li class="c1">
        <span>Deploying and running software code.</span></li><li class="c1">
                <span>Creating &ldquo;mining identities&rdquo; that enable participation in mining the network
                    using special client software.</span></li><li class="c1"><span>Creating &ldquo;neurons&rdquo;
        that enable participation in decentralized governance created by a &ldquo;Blockchain Nervous System&rdquo;
        .</span></li><li class="c1"><span>Connecting private cloud compute platforms created using DFINITY technology
                to the DFINITY Network so the software they host can interact with public systems.</span></li></ul>
        <p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><h3>The DFINITY Foundation</h3></p><p class="c2 c3">
        <h3></h3></p><p class="c2"><span>Numerous parties and organizations (&ldquo;Participants&rdquo;)
                wish for the DFINITY Network to come into existence so that they can build applications on a
                decentralized compute cloud platform, so they can create private compute clouds using its technology
                that that might be connected to the DFINITY Network, so they can run computations using the software
                that other parties have installed on the DFINITY Network, or so that they can participate in mining
                the network or participate in its governance. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span>To support the development of the network&rsquo;s protocols and technology,
                a not-for-profit foundation has been created (the &ldquo;Foundation&rdquo;) in Zug, Switzerland,
                that is tax exempt. The Foundation will be funded by donations. Participants may wish to make donations
                to the Foundation to support the pursuit of its objectives. The Foundation will accept donations from
                Participants in three automated funding rounds performed using the Ethereum network and other mechanisms.
            </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><h3>Collecting Donations and Allocating DFN
        </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><h3></h3></p><p class="c2"><span>Since the network requires Participants
                to hold DFN in order to function, donations to the Foundation will be recorded in a special smart
                contract hosted on Ethereum (the &ldquo;FDC&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Foundation Donations Contract&rdquo;).
                &nbsp;The hope of the Foundation is that the FDC will define the initial allocations of DFN made to
                Participants. Therefore when the Foundation judges that special client software (the &ldquo;Client&rdquo;)
                required to create the network is sufficiently mature, and other factors make launch of the network
                possible, the Foundation will recommend that the FDC is used as part of an initial state
                (&ldquo;Genesis State&rdquo;) of the DFINITY Network.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span>It is important to understand that an open decentralized network results from the
                activities of independent participants performing mining activities around the world. Because such
            &ldquo;miners&rdquo; are independent, the Foundation cannot guarantee that its recommendation to
                use the FDC as the basis of initial allocations of DFN in the Genesis State will be adopted. It is
                merely hoped that this will be the case because miners generally have an incentive to agree on some
                logical Genesis State that reflects contributions made to the project.</span></p><p class="c2 c3">
        <span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Donations (&ldquo;Donations&rdquo;) will be collected from donors
                (&ldquo;Donors&rdquo;) in ETH/&rdquo;ether&rdquo;, BTC/&rdquo;bitcoin&rdquo; and CHF/&rdquo;Swiss
                francs&rdquo;. The FDC will record the nominal value of each Donation in CHF. The current exchange rate
                used to calculate the nominal value of a Donation is at the sole discretion of the Foundation.
                Furthermore, the value of a Donation recorded will be the product of the actual money value calculated
                using the exchange rate and a current multiplier (&ldquo;Multiplier&rdquo;) designed to reflect that
                earlier Donations are more valuable for the project.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span>The Foundation will make available an official software system that can enable Donors
                to make Donations. Only this system should be used to make Donations.</span></p><p class="c2 c3">
        <span></span></p><p class="c2"><h3>The Donation Collection Rounds</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><h3></h3>
        </p><p class="c2"><span>Donations will be collected in three rounds: The first round (&ldquo;Bootstrap
                Round&rdquo;) will be restricted to those who have already made early contributions to the project
                in the form of enabling technologies and other forms of support. The Foundation intends to recommend
                that Donations made in the Bootstrap Round are matched to allocations of DFN in the Genesis State that
                are equal to 20% of whatever total quantity of DFN is allocated. Thus if a total of 1000 DFN are
                allocated in the Genesis State, exactly 200 DFN will be divided amongst those Donors making Donations
                in the Bootstrap Round.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>A &ldquo;Seed
                Round&rdquo; and &ldquo;Main Round&rdquo; in which anyone can make donations will follow the Bootstrap
                Round. &nbsp;The intention is that the Main Round will be run after a beta version of the DFINITY Network
                has been launched that clearly showcases its technology. These rounds will last a maximum of six weeks,
                or will terminate 1 hour after they succeed in collecting a targeted amount of donations
                (&ldquo;Funding Targets&rdquo;) measured by their equivalent value in CHF/&rdquo;Swiss francs&rdquo;.
                The Seed Round has a Funding Target of 1,000,000 CHF and the Main Round has a Funding Target of
                20,000,000 CHF. Because these funding rounds will continue to run for 1 hour after their Funding
                Targets have been met, they may collect more value than the Funding Targets.</span></p><p class="c2 c3">
        <span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The Foundation intends to recommend that 80% of the total DFN allocated
                in the Genesis State are allocated in consideration of Donations made in the Seed Round and Main Round.
        As a baseline, 10 DFN will be allocated for every 1 CHF in value that is recorded as donated by the FDC.
        During the Seed Round, the Multiplier will be 2.5X. During the Main Round, a different Multiplier will be
        applied in each successive week: 1.25X, 1.20X, 1.15X, 1.10X, 1.05X and 1.00X.</span></p><p class="c2 c3">
        <span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The Seed Round is expected to take place in December 2016.
        The Main Round is scheduled to take place on the 1</span><span class="c5">st</span><span>&nbsp;of March 2017,
        but can be delayed a maximum of three times for 1 month by the Foundation using a privileged call it can
        make into the FDC.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><h3>Restrictions and Warnings</span></p>
        <p class="c2 c3"><h3></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Only those who (i) are interested in participating in the
        DFINITY Network in the prescribed ways, and (ii) wish to further the development of its technologies for
        philanthropic reasons and accept the project might fail completely should become Donors. The purpose of any
        DFN that the Foundation recommends are allocated in the Genesis State is to mediate participation in the
        DFINITY Network and it may cause harm to the network if these tokens are alternatively allocated to speculators.
        Furthermore, due to the ambitious aims of the DFINITY project described and the uncertain viability of developing
        a &ldquo;decentralized cloud computing&rdquo; platform generally any speculator making Donations with the
        intention of receiving DFN allocations they can resell for profit will probably make a loss on average. </span>
    </p><p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Due to the uncertain nature of regulations in the United
        States, citizens and residents of the United States cannot make Donations at this time.</span></p><p class="c2 c3">
