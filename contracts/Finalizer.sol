/* Helper contract to, in a single tx, make multiple calls to the
   unauthenticated `unrestrict` function in the FDC.

   Originally we wanted the FDC API to finalize all early contributor
   addresses, but since this could easily run OOG, the FDC API instead
   takes a single address so we can guarantee upper bound on gas usage
   per call.

   With a configurable loop outside the FDC, we can easily finalize
   thousands of addresses over N blocks, with N depending on what the
   block gas limit is at time of finalization.
